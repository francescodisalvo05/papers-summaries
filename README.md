# Paper summaries

Inspired by Adrian Colyer (known for [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/)) and Vitaly Kurin (known as [YobiByte](https://yobibyte.github.io/)), I decided to share summaries of the papers I read for my research and for fun.

I usually *try* to stay up-to-date through the latest conferences, as well as with notifications from Google Scholar and ArXiv. Recently, I also started using and fine-tuning [scholar-inbox](https://www.scholar-inbox.com/), a paper recommender system developed at the University of TÃ¼bingen [[news](https://tuebingen.ai/news/stay-ahead-in-research-with-scholar-inbox)].
